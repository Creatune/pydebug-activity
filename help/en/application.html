<li><h1>Project Page -- The basic services of the PyDebug</h1><img src="images/Screenshot_1_2.jpg" alt="Project Page" border="2" class = "right" />
The Project Page is divided horizontally into two halves. The left side includes various sources and destinations where you can get program examples and put your modified programs. The right side shows the contents of the activity.info file and the collection of files that make up an Activity. The right side of the screen can be thought of as a sand box or playpen where your program can act, misbehave, and show all its &quot;bugs&quot;. As you develop the python programs that make up your activity you may want to save it fairly often just in case one of your ideas turns out to be a blind alley.</p>
<p>The top box on the left side represents the journal. At any time you can save the current state of your program to the Journal. You do this by clicking on the left arrow between the Journal box and the playpen. The process of creating a bundle is computer intensive and slow, but the end result conserves space on the disk, and bandwidth when the activity is being shared across the network. When you do this, it is saved in a <a href="what_is_an_activity.html">Activity bundle</a> (with a name ending in &quot;.xo&quot;) or a unix archive format (ending with &quot;.tar.gz&quot;). </p>
<p>The standard XO bundle is the default. The &quot;tar.gz&quot; form will only be used under unusual cirmstances. Perhaps the &quot;activity.info&quot; file, or the startup icon file  is missing, or has some errors.</p>
<p><img src="images/Screenshot.jpg" alt="journal"  border="2" class="left" /> </p>
<p>When you click on the right arrow, you are asking the debugger to load an XO file into the workspace. This will replace any activity that is already occupying the workspace. The checksum of the activity that is about to be overwritten will be checked against the checksum stored away the last time the activity was saved. If there have been changes since the last save, a notification will be presented before any changes are lost. </p><img src="images/installed.jpg" alt="Installed Activities" width="399" height="300" border="2" class="right" />
<p>The middle box, initially labeled &quot;INSTALLED ACTIVITIES:&quot;, is actually located on the XO at /home/olpc/Activities/. This is a list of all the Activities that are loaded on your XO. You can highlight any of these activities and load it into the workarea of the debugger. Then if you click on the edit tab, you will find that five python program files are opened and displayed. The /home/olpc/Activities/ directory, is read-only. You do not have sufficient permissions to write to this location. (Notice that there is only a right arrow shown beside the &quot;installed Activities&quot; box). </p><img src="images/home.jpg" alt="Home " width="399" height="300" border="2" class="left" />
<p>By clicking the &quot;home&quot; button, the user can switch what the middle box is displayinghe  to &quot;PyDebg Home Storage:&quot;, where storing data is permitted. In Unix computers, this place to store your own files, is sometimes called the &quot;HOME&quot; directory. When your home directory is displayed, the &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; arrows are are both visible, and the debugger <img src="images/examples.jpg" alt="Examples" border="2" class="right"  />is able to  copy the full unzipped Activity tree in either direction between the debugger home and the the playpen/sandbox. Limited only by your total disk space you can keep any number of activity trees in your home directory. The &quot;home&quot; button toggles between the &quot;installed&quot; directory and the &quot;home&quot; directory.</p>
<p>The Examples box provides a set of templates and features of the XO which are chosen to be helpful toward the objective of developing activities. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The &quot;PROJECT INFORMATION&quot; for Activity under development is the right side of the screen:<img src="images/Screenshot5.jpg" alt="playpen" border="2" class= "right" />  </p>
<p>The project name will be used as the first part of the root directory for your activity. In order to function properly, the second part of the root durectory will be set automatically by the debugger to &quot;.activity&quot;. The version is included in the XO file name, and displayed in the journal. It should be changed whenever you make a significant change to your program. </p>
<p>The Unique ID must be some string of characters that is that: unique. This will be used by the dbus session manager to identify your activity and service it properly. The OLPC developers suggest that you use a url that you own, or the prefix &quot;org.laptop&quot; plus a name that you place in the OLPC git repository. </p>
<p>To start up properly, using the standard XO session manager, the start-up script needs the name of the module, and the class which will start your activity. This will probably be the class you write which sub-classes the &quot;sugar.activity.activity.Activity&quot; which is the starting point for most activitiies. </p>
<p>Your activity needs a &quot;SVG&quot; icon to represent it on the desktop. This icon is normally created using a vector drawing program like &quot;inkscape&quot;. But for debugging purposes, you can quickly generate a two character icon that is surrounded by the following shapes: (circle, square, diamond, star). If you choose to use this PyDebug-generated icon, it will be named &quot;&lt;the name you put in the Name field&gt;.svg&quot; and the appropriate icon designation will be written to the &quot;activity.info&quot; file. During program development, this icon will probably be sufficient. At some time in the future, when your Activity is almost ready for public release, you may want to create an icon that harmonizes with the other icons. </p>
<h2>Editing Python programs</h2>
<p><img src="images/editing_pydebug.jpg" alt="Edit Page" width="400" height="300" border="2" class = "left" />When you load an Activity into the PyDebug workspace, the Editor will automatically load the 5 largest python programs, (those filenames ending with &quot;.py&quot;) from the root Activity directory. Whenever you start running your program, before the first breakpoint is reached, any changes that you have made to your programs will be saved to the disk. If you do not want this automatic saving of changes, you should click on the &quot;X&quot; on the tab of the file that you do not want to save, and answer &quot;cancel&quot; to the alert asking whether you want the program to be saved. If you do not have permissions to write a file back to its original location,  the debugger will ask you whether, as an alternative, you want the altered file to be written to the playpen with your other files. </p>
<p>One of the most productive ways to program is to find programs that do approximately what you want your program to do. Then cut and paste that small portion of code into yours, and modify it to do what you want.  Often, when you use cut and paste, you will need to change variable names. For this, use the find and replace (magnifier icon). </p>

<h2>Running programs</h2>
<p>From the project page, click on the &quot;Run Program&quot; icon. Or if your have already changed to the &quot;Activity&quot; tab, you can type &quot;go&quot; . This will start your program as a sugar activity, if possble, and stop it at the first &quot;import&quot; statement. </p>
<p>At that point you can enter a &quot;c&quot; for &quot;continue&quot;, and the program will continue until it finishes or until it encounters an unhandled exception. Alternatively you can set &quot;b&quot;reakpoints, &quot;s&quot;tep, or make the call and return to the &quot;n&quot;ext statement in the current routine. </p>
<h3>Switching between the text-mode and graphical screens </h3>
<p>Use &lt;alt&gt;-&lt;tab&gt; to switch between the graphical output page created by your application, and the text-mode debugging screen of the PyDebug Activity. </p>
<h2>Getting help  </h2><img src="images/help.jpg" alt="termina page"  border="2" class="right" />
<p>The help section of PyDebug is drawn from many web sites and included as a starting point for programmers and learners who do not have continuous access to the internet. It includes useful information and documentation.</p>
<p>One of the most useful sources of information is the python programs themselves that exist on your XO. The XXX icon on the help page starts up a local html server called pydoc. This will give you summary information and how to interface with all the sugar programs.</p>
<p>For people who have some knowledge of programming, but are new to python, the &quot;DIVE INTO PYTHON&quot; is a short introduction to the python programming language.  </p>
