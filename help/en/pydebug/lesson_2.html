<h1>Learn 10+ Essential UNIX Commands</h1>
<p>For the learning Terminal commands, let's load the HelloWorld.activity from the <a href="project_page.html#examples" >examples window</a> on the project tab. </p>

<p>We can  use the Terminal built into PyDebug. Click on the &quot;Activity&quot; tab at the upper left. Then type &lt;control&gt;D. You should see &quot;[HelloWorld.activity]$&quot;. This is the terminal prompt, and tells you that the Terminal is ready to listen to your commands. </p>
<p>Here is a quick list of the commands we will be using in this lesson (there is also a <a href="../bash/">more complete list</a> of commands): </p>
<ol>
  <li>ls -- list contents of current directory </li>
  <li>cd -- change directory </li>
  <li>pwd -- print working directory </li>
  <li>mkdir - make a new directory (rmdir - remove directory) </li>
  <li>cp -- copy file or directory </li>
  <li>rm - remove file or directory </li>
  <li>df -- disk free </li>
  <li>du -- disk used </li>
  <li>whoami -- who am I? </li>
  <li>su -- super user </li>
  <li>less -- improved version of &quot;more&quot; -- the original unix page viewer </li>
  <li>vi -- visual text editor -- available and installed by default on all unix machines </li>
</ol>
<h3>Files and Folders</h3>
<p>The Journal of the XO is a simplified view of the file system. It is a single container, or  folder, that contains ONLY files. The Journal shows the most recent things on top. The order is based upon time. This simplified view of the file system hides a lot of what is actually stored on your XO. </p>
<p>In actual fact, Folders can contain  other folders, as well as files. Often the complication comes when you can't remember which folder you put something in. It's there somewhere, but you can't find it. Your files will be easier to find if you learn the rules, where things are usually kept in a unix computer. </p>
<p> The first part of this lesson asks you to become familiar with some of the folders and files on your XO. </p>
