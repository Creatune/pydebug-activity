<h1>Why this Template? </h1>
<p>The installed base which is most of the 1.5 Million XO's has the following code on line 156 of webview.py for adjusting the visibility of html: 
<pre>	def set_visibility(self, visibility):
	 	logging.debug(&quot;nsIEmbeddingSiteWindow.set_visibility: %r&quot; % visibility)
	  		if visibility:
				self.web_view.show()
				self.web_view.get_toplevel().show()
		  	else:
				self.web_view.get_toplevel().hide()


This makes it difficult to use the webview widget in applications that want to display html based Help because
when you want to hide the help page, you simultaneously end up hiding the rest of your application.
 (F11 code has corrected this shortcoming).


This HelpTemplate creates a new and separate window, so that the hide toplevel doesn't hide the rest of 
your application. In order to use this strategy, you will need to create the same number of tabs on the
help page so that the user doesn't percieve that he is actually on a separate window.


Admittedly, it's a little kludgey, but it will let your help pages be visible on old sugar builds.</pre>
